title: Why Astrolicious?
---

_This piece thought piece clarifies my - [alexanderniebuhr](https://github.com/alexanderniebuhr) - personal view and opinions. It is not meant to represent the opinion of every Astrolious member, but it still sets our vision and all members holding a role should stand behind it._

## How it all started

There was some discussions in the Astro Discord way back at the end of 2023, about the idea of having a more _"unofficial official"_ inititive to hold community projects.
Past efforts didn't work out, and having everything scattered creates some challenges. Users might not adopt community projects, because they don't have a way to validate if a project is well maintained or of high quality.
The dream was born: A unofficial trusted source for communitiy projects, where users can be assured that the projects are well maintained, following a high quality standard and are safe to use.
This should prevent attacks on the dependency chain and benefit Astro itself. Why? Well Astro is great and we all love it, in matter a fact we love it so much that we all invest time to make community resources to explore new opportunities, support more use-cases or just share solutions with others. I personally think the correct way for any crazy idea is to try it out as a community project, and have it adopted upstream when time has come. Community means showing ideas, sharing passion and love and working together to drive adoption.

## Strive to make Astro better

So we outlined that community projects are very important for an open-source ecosystem, but we still need to make sure we don't loose the focus here. We are not doing this to be competitive, gain stars, or get rich.
Our passion and motivation is to make Astro better, we try to make Astro more adoptable, allow exploration, and push experimentation by giving contributors a trusted save space to do that.
A dedicated inititive allows Astro to breathe and grow. And even if we all have a lot of passion and entusiasm towards Astrolicious, we still prioritize Astro. We do not exist to kill Astro, we exist because of Astro.

## How we differ from Astro?

We shape our target audience very sharply and it's important to understand how we differ from Astro.
While we do have some projects under our umbrella which target Astro users, because those project can be added to their site, we mainly focus on a different group of people. Astrolicious is targeted towards integration authors, theme authors and contributors of community projects. Astro has also a space for them and this is very important, we want to keep communication and connection between both. 
However we are able to provide a space which isn't as full and diverse as Astro's. Integartion authors, theme authors and contributors of community projects can go furhter and dive deeper with Astrolicious in addition to engaging with Astro.

## Which Discord is for me?

It looks confusion on the first view, but I can promise it's super easy to understand.
First things first, if you are not a member of the [Astro Discord](https://astro.build/chat), you need to stop reading, join our Astro Discord.
We welcome everyone on both servers, but we still have some advice which one to join.

That also outlines it very clearly, everyone engaging with Astrolicious should be on the Astro Discord. We work actively against splitting the community. The Astro Discord was, is, and always will be the first station to go to for anyone inside the Astro community. And if you have a Astro site, you won't need the Astrolicious Discord at all.

The [Astrolicious Discord](https://chat.astrolicious.dev) does offer a space for integration authors, theme authors, and contributors of our community projects. The Astrolicious Discord will not have support for usage of those projects, we do have a very helpful and active #support channel on the Astro Discord for that.
In addition to that, if you are looking for advice how to start your first own community project, the #integration channel is a perfect start, only if you feel the need to dive deeper, the Astrolicious server might provide some value.

## Post Mortem

We only succeed if Astro succeeds and get's stronger every day. We do work on that goal together daily and would love to invite you too. Whenever you feel concerns or are unsure about anything, please reach out to us., we want to make this very clear and make sure everyone sees our vision.
