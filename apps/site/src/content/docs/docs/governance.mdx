This document outlines the governance structure for _**Astrolicious**_, hereafter referred to as "the Project." It defines the roles, responsibilities, and procedures for participants and outlines the process for making decisions and managing contributions.

## Our Mission

_**Astrolicious**_ is an independent community organization, unaffiliated with the official Astro project or its maintainers. Our mission is to harness the collective power and creativity of our community to build and maintain a suite of resources, tools, and extensions that complement and enhance the wider ecosystem surrounding Astro. By bringing together community-driven contributions, we aim to facilitate a collaborative environment where individuals can contribute, learn, and benefit from a larger pool of shared knowledge and tools. Our goal is to foster innovation, support the growth of all contributors, and create a robust foundation that enables our community to thrive alongside the evolving landscape of web development. We are committed to inclusivity, open collaboration, and the shared success of our members, independent of, yet respectful to, the Astro project and its goals.

### Stewards

The pinnacle role overseeing the project's overall well-being, inclusivity, and sustainability. They prevent the project from being dominated by single entities. Stewards' responsibilities are not funded, though they may receive funding for other roles.

### Masterminds

Known also as the "Board" or "Technical Steering Committee," they are the decision-making core, ensuring the project's and community's health. Masterminds oversee organizational decisions, affecting integrated projects but not standalone ones due to their independent nature. Mastermind' responsibilities are not funded, though they may receive funding for other roles.

### Enthusiasts

Engaged members passionate about the project, acting as community ambassadors without participating in decision-making. They represent the community externally. Enthusiast' responsibilities are not funded, though they may receive funding for other roles.

### Maintainers

Project maintainers with autonomy to maintain projects in line with established decisions and directions. They are eligible for optional funding based on time, activity commitments and fund availability.

### Triaging

Triage roles

### Studio CMS

Project maintainers with autonomy to maintain projects in line with established decisions and directions. They are eligible for optional funding based on time, activity commitments and fund availability.


## Retiring a Role (Alumni)

Roles are granted for as long as the person wishes to engage with the project. However, over time an active community member may choose to step away from the project to work on other things. Moving on from a project is a natural and well-understood part of any open source community, and we celebrate it!

**Alumni** is a special designation and role for any person who had once an role assigned but is now no longer actively involved. By retiring and joining Alumni you trade-in your current set of roles, privileges, and responsibilities for a new, special Alumni role (which comes with its own set of Privileges, as described above).

You can retire your role at any time and requesting Alumni status. You can initiate this action yourself if you know ahead-of-time that you need to step away from the project. Or, if you have gone several months without interacting with the community, the project may actively reach out to you to discuss retiring as a way to make room for new members.

As an Alumni member, you are still a part of the community. You may also request to have your old roles reinstated at any time through the normal process for that role.
